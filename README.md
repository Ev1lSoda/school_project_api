# school_project_api

To run this API and use it you need 2 things:

1. to load the dump file back into the server:
2. install all node packages
   To do so run `npm install` in main directory of the project and `mysql -u(your username for local instance MySQL) -p(your password for local instance MySQL)` in "SQL" directory

After doing this steps you will be able to run program just type `npm start`, when it starts you will see 2 arrays, first one is "getAllTeachers" it represents list of all teachers in DB and the second one is "getTargetMathTeachers" it is a list of math teachers that is chousen by the rules in task.

Then you could make some requests to API, I recommend you to use Postman, I also have a collection of all requests in "postman_collection" folder. Program has 5 requests, 4 is for CRUD and 1 is for "getTargetMathTeachers" method, I will shortly demonstrate them:

1. Add(Create) new teacher in DB:

   Here we added art teacher Robin Robinson to our DB.
2. Read(get) teacher(s) info from DB, here we insert the parameter by which we want to get teacher(s):

   Here we get all teachers aged 88ÑŽ
   **to get all teachers you should send empty teacher object `{teacher{}}`**
3. Update teacher, this request takes "teacherId" parameter to find wich row should be modified:

   Here we changed Robin Robinson from being art teacher to english teacher.
4. Delete tacher, this request takes only one parameter "teacherId", so you can only delete one teacher by one request:

   Here we deleted our teacher Robin Robinson.
5. getTargetMathTeacher, get specified math teachers:
